# lostOnes

##Summary
lostOnes is a CRUD application modeled after pet adoption platforms, such as Petfinder or Petango.  At present, unregistered users have the ability to edit delete or "adopt" pets from the 
listed on the site; authenticated users have the option to save their favorite pets in a 'favorites' view. Addtional functionality will be added and was initially planned, but 
pushed back due to unforseen issues that came up during the development process.

##Planning/Design
Because this was my first attempt at using Foundation css for styling, I avoided wireframes altogether due to not being sure if I'd be able to replicate exactly what I had in mind.  
A good chunk of time was spent reviewing the Foundation documentation, along with experimenting with different elements/classes to better understand its behavior and how it differs from frameworks I've used previously.
As far as functionality is concerned, I had a few ideas in mind,

##Technology
All of the obvious stuff (js, mongoDB, etc.), with some additional middleware, as well as a configuration for user authentication.

##Nice-to-haves/plans for the future
As luck would have it, Petfinder has an open API, so the plan is to integrate some of that information sometime in the near future.
I also planned to include search functionality, which I unfortunately did not have time to implement.
Additionally, I'd like to make the distinction between an "org" account and a standard user account, to place restrictions on how pets can be added.
